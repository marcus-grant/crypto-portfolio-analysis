# Ad Hoc Analysis Notebook for Cryptocurrency Portfolio

A jupyter notebook I use to make strategy level decisions on my cryptocurrency portfolios. I currently only use Gemini as my Fiat entry point, which generally just sends its funds directly to bittrex. On bittrex I currently maintain about $2000 worth of assets that I use for active trading. Then on various cold storage wallets and staking nodes I keep a cold storage portfolio, that though right now quite small, will grow as I'm currently setting a ceiling of $2000 on my bittrex portfolio where I send winnings to the cold storage wallet.
